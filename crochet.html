      <p>Crocheting is one of my favorite hobbies! Here are a few reasons why:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It's pretty easy to learn the basics!</li>
        <li>You can crochet while doing something else, like talking or watching a movie.</li>
        <li>If you want to spend more time on it, you can make really complex projects.</li>
        <li>The materials are light and easy to carry! You just need yarn and a crochet hook.</li>
        <li>After your project is done, you have something beautiful and functional that you made yourself!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Here's a quick crochet tutorial. This will show you everything you need to make a blanket or a scarf!</p>
      <p>Tie a slipknot in the yarn.</p>
      <img src="images/crochet1.jpg" alt="Crochet hook and loop in yarn">
      <p>Put your crochet hook through the loop.</p>
      <img src="images/crochet2.jpg" alt="Crochet hook through loop in yarn">
      <p>Grab the yarn with the hook.</p>
      <img src="images/crochet3.jpg" alt="Crochet hook grabbing yarn">
      <p>Pull the yarn through the loop.</p>
      <img src="images/crochet4.jpg" alt="Crochet hook pulling yarn through a yarn loop">
      <p>Now, you have a new loop on the hook! What you just did is called chaining. Continue pulling yarn through the loops.</p>
      <img src="images/crochet5.jpg" alt="Chain of loops in yarn with crochet hook through last loop">
      <p>As you keep chaining, you will begin to make a long chain (as the name suggests). Make this chain as long as you want. If you want to make a scarf or blanket, make the chain as long as the desired width of your scarf/blanket.</p>
      <img src="images/crochet6.jpg" alt="Longer chain of loops in yarn with crochet hook through last loop">
      <p>Once your chain is as long as you want it, flip it over. This side should look something like an actual metal chain. Note the small bumps facing towards you.</p>
      <img src="images/crochet7.jpg" alt="Previous chain flipped over">
      <p>Insert your hook in the second bump from your hook. You should now have two loops on your hook.</p>
      <img src="images/crochet8.jpg" alt="Crochet hook with two yarn loops">
      <p>Grab the yarn...</p>
      <img src="images/crochet9.jpg" alt="Crochet hook grabbing yarn">
      <p>And pull through the first loop, leaving two loops on your hook (one being the new loop you just made).</p>
      <img src="images/crochet10.jpg" alt="Crochet hook with two yarn loops">
      <p>Grab the yarn again...</p>
      <img src="images/crochet11.jpg" alt="Crochet hook grabbing yarn">
      <p>And pull through both loops, leaving one loop on your hook. What we just did is called a single crochet! This is the basic stitch of crochet, and will be even easier in later rows.</p>
      <img src="images/crochet12.jpg" alt="Crochet hook with one yarn loop">
      <p>Put a single crochet in every bump on your chain.</p>
      <img src="images/crochet13.jpg" alt="Row of single crochet stitches">
      <p>Now, flip your work over.</p>
      <img src="images/crochet14.jpg" alt="Flipped row of crochet stitches">
      <p>Look at the first teardrop-shaped loop. </p>
      <img src="images/crochet15.jpg" alt="Top of row">
      <p>Insert your hook under the teardrop. You should now have three loops on your hook.</p>
      <img src="images/crochet16.jpg" alt="Crochet hook with three yarn loops">
      <p>Grab the yarn...</p>
      <img src="images/crochet17.jpg" alt="Crochet hook grabbing yarn">
      <p>And pull through both loops of the teardrop, leaving two loops on your hook.</p>
      <img src="images/crochet18.jpg" alt="Crochet hook with two yarn loops">
      <p>Grab the yarn...</p>
      <img src="images/crochet19.jpg" alt="Crochet hook grabbing yarn">
      <p>And pull through both loops, leaving one on your hook. (This is another single crochet!)</p>
      <img src="images/crochet20.jpg" alt="Crochet hook with one yarn loop">
      <p>Congratulations! You now know everything you need to crochet a scarf, blanket, coaster, or any other rectangular shape!</p>
      <p>If you mess up, don't worry. Crochet is easy to learn, but takes a  minute to master. Trust me, you will get there!</p>
      <p>Also, here's a crochet tutorial video from Kristin's Crochet Tutorials!</p>

      <p>If you make something using these instructions, it will be a thick but stretchy fabric.</p>

      <p>If you learn a few more advanced techniques (literally just wrapping the yarn around the hook, it's not as hard as it seems!) you can make patterns!</p>
      <p>This is a striped pattern using rows of alternating size stitches.</p>

      <p>This is a diamond/DNA pattern using alternate size stitches in the same row.</p>

      <p>Enjoy! I hope I can inspire you to start crocheting. It's been a very productive and fun hobby for me.</p>
