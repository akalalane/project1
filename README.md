# project1
Project 1 is a website made for IIT's CS 331: Fundamentals of Web Development class.   
This website is intended to showcase my HTML abilities without using any CSS.  
I have included my resume, my stories about volunteering at a wildlife center, and a description of my origami hobby.  
Please enjoy!
