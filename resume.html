			As a high school student:


			I have attended Jones College Prep in Chicago, IL from September 2019. 
			Through hard work and dedication, I have excelled academically. I have a 3.75 GPA, a score of 1530 on the SAT, and a score of 34 on the ACT. I am on my school’s Honor Roll, and I have received the AP Scholar Award with Honor for distinguished performance in AP college-level classes.

			The AP Scholar Award with Honor is given only to students who have received an average score of 3.25/5 or higher on all AP exams, and have taken at least 4 AP classes. In my case, I have taken 4 AP classes with a 4.75 average score. I earned a 4/5 in AP Chemistry and a 5/5 in AP Biology, AP Calculus, and AP Computer Science. AP courses are all equivalent to high-rigor college classes, and a 3 or above earns a student college credit. My scores thus far are equivalent to 20 credit hours at most US colleges and universities.

I can take customer orders in all of these languages, and could resolve customer complaints in English, Spanish, and Japanese. I am also currently in a high-level Mandarin class in school, so my Mandarin skills will improve as the year goes on.
